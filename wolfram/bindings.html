      <h3>J/Link</h3>
      <p>J/Link lets you call Java from the Wolfram Language in a completely transparent way, and it also lets you use and control the
        Wolfram Language kernel from a Java program. For Wolfram Language users, J/Link makes the whole universe of existing and future
        Java classes an automatic extension to the Wolfram Language environment. For Java programmers, J/Link turns the Wolfram Language
        into a scripting shell that lets you experiment with, build, and test Java classes a line at a time. It also makes Java the ideal
        language for writing programs that use the computational services of the Wolfram Language.</p>

      <h3>C/C++ LibraryLink</h3>
      <p>Wolfram LibraryLink provides a powerful way to connect external code to the Wolfram Language, enabling high-speed and memory-efficient
        execution. It does this by allowing dynamic libraries to be directly loaded into the Wolfram Language kernel so that functions in the
        libraries can be immediately called from the Wolfram Language. You can exchange not only C-like data types such as integers, reals,
        packed arrays, and strings, but also arbitrary Wolfram Language expressions. In addition, there are useful functions such as sending
        errors and calling back to the Wolfram Language.</p>

      <h3>RLink</h3>
      <p>R is a programming language and software environment for statistical computing and graphics. RLink is a Wolfram System application
        that uses JLink and RJava / JRI Java libraries to link to the R functionality. It allows the user to communicate the data between
        the Wolfram Language and R, and execute R code from within the Wolfram Language.</p>

      <h3>.NET/Link</h3>
      <p> .NET/Link lets you call .NET from the Wolfram Language in a completely transparent way, and allows you to use and control the Wolfram
        Language kernel from a .NET program. For Wolfram Language users, .NET/Link makes the entire .NET world an automatic extension to the
        Wolfram Language environment. For .NET programmers, .NET/Link turns the Wolfram Language into a scripting shell that lets you experiment
        with, build, and test .NET classes a line at a time. It also makes .NET an ideal environment for writing programs that use the
