      <h3>MATLink</h3>
      <p>MATLink is a Mathematica application that allows the user to communicate data between Mathematica and MATLAB, as well
        as execute MATLAB code and seamslesly call MATLAB functions from within Mathematica. It uses MathLink to communicate
        between Mathematica and MATLAB (via the MATLAB Engine library).</p>

      <h3>Theorema</h3>
      <p>Theorema is a system for automated reasoning and theorem proving with the Wolfram Language. It was conceived and initiated around
        1995 by Bruno Buchberger and reflects his view of "doing mathematics". It is being
        developed under his guidance by the Theorema Working Group at the Research Institute for Symbolic Computation, Johannes Kepler
        University, Linz - Hagenberg, Austria. Theorema 2.0 is a major re-launch mainly developed by Wolfgang Windsteiger.</p>
